<h1> Blog - Unity Power ups and Cutscenes! </h1>
<br>
In the below video, I cover my implementation of a power-up system and logic-cutscene system. These were my favourite implementations so far.

The first thing I set out to do after the last post was to completely reimplement the control system since it wasn't fully functional already.
As the end goal of the project is to have the game control with an Xbox gamepad, I decided to take this into account from the start and instead of 
basing it on 8 absolute directions that represent what you can do with a keyboard, it follows the axis of the gamepad's joystick, and the movement is already 
much more free.
