<h1> Blog - Unity Follow camera! </h1>
<br>
In the below video I demonstrate the use of a follow camera in Unity. It controls using the right joystick.

Once I finished re-implementing the player controls for a joypad, it really opened my eyes as to how much better the game can feel with optimised controls!
The only issue I have with this camera is that the controls invert once it goes behind the player. It is something that I will need to look into in the near future.
