Pong was a great step forward.
==
Pong was developed in C++, again utilising the ASGE Framework of all of my ESD-related games.
The goal of pong is to bounce the ball past the enemy's paddle into their side of the screen.
The game has two primary modes: 1 v 1 PvP, and 1 v 1 PvAI. There is an additional difficulty wherein the AI moves faster than the player.

This version was developed at the end of my first semester, utilising all of the knowledge I had gained up until this point.
The game that came out of this was successful, though with a few issues.
I learned from each of my mistakes with this project, and I will definitely return to it in the future.
