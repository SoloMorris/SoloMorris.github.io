Pong.
==
Pong was developed in C++, utilising the ASGE framework - standard for all games developed in the Entertainment Software Development module at UWE.
The goal of pong is to bounce the ball past the enemy's paddle into their side of the screen.
The game has two primary modes: 1 v 1 PvP - where one player controls using WASD and the other uses the arrow keys -
and 1 v 1 PvAI, where the second player is following the ball's movements.  There is an additional difficulty wherein the AI moves faster than the player.

This version was developed at the end of my first semester, utilising all of the knowledge I had gained up until this point.
The game will be uploaded to Itch.io soon.
