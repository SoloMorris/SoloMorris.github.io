<h1> A look into what the industry wants. </h1>
<br>
At the start of this year, we did some research into what jobs were currently available for
Gameplay Programmers in the UK.

Using sites like Indeed.co.uk and Glassdoor.com, we found several jobs going at AAA developers
such as Sony and Ubisoft, as well as smaller and indie studios.

Afterwards, we took a look into what they wanted - what skills are desired by these companies,
and is there a correlation?
