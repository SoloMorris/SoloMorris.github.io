Pong was a great step forward.
==

Developing a functioning version of pong, using the skills developed over the course of my first semester was a challenge that was both incredibly fun to tackle and an amazing learning experience.
Much of the code used in earlier worksheets was repurposed here, but I made attempts to add distinct programming ideas and a simple visual aesthetic to the game.
Mine was to make use of a class that had a similar function but much lese efficiency than an enumerator (prior to my learning of their existence).

The game that came out of this was successful, though with a few issues.
I learned from each of my mistakes with this project, and I will definitely return to it in the future.
