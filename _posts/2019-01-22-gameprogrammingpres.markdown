<h1> A look into what the industry wants. </h1>
<br>
At the start of this year, we did some research into what jobs were currently available for
Gameplay Programmers in the UK.

Using sites like Indeed.co.uk and Glassdoor.com, we found several jobs going at AAA developers
such as Sony and Ubisoft, as well as smaller and indie studios.
<br>
Afterwards, we took a look into what they wanted - what skills are desired by these companies,
and is there a correlation?

<br>

We found that AAA developers: 
Tended to want several years of programming experience, particularly in C++ or C#,
An understanding and experience with a contemporary engine, such as Unity or Unreal Engine,
A portfolio of previously released successful AAA games,
and a BSc degree or relevant equivalent.

<br>
Afterwards, we took a look at smaller and indie studios and what they asked of staff in similar,
if not equivalent, roles.

<br>

The data gathered from this part of the research is slightly less reliable, as most indie studios 
that we found did not have specific "gameplay programming" jobs, so we also took from the closest equivalent.

We found that smaller developers:
Wanted only "experience" in C++ or equivalent programming,
A BSc and/or relevant portfolio
<br>
This is quite a bit less than what is asked by AAA developers. 
While indie game jobs are typically less lucrative than with larger studios, it would be beneficial to develop
games as an independent developer in order to develop the skillset and portfolio asked of larger studios.
